Tired of dull and unattractive vector layers in PyQGIS? Look no further! In this step-by-step guide, we'll show you how to enhance the appearance of your vector layers using simple markers. From adjusting the size of the circles to changing the color of the symbols, you'll be able to create visually stunning maps in no time. So grab your data and let's get started! And don't forget to subscribe to our channel for more helpful content.

To begin, you'll need to download the data that we'll be using from this link: [**data**](https://github.com/Azad77/Python_qgis/blob/main/Data/KRG_Cities.zip).

Next, you'll need to load the point type shapefile. To change the size of the circle, use the following code:

```python
uri = "D:/Python_QGIS/data/KRG_Cities.shp"
vlayer = iface.addVectorLayer(uri, "KRG_Cities", "ogr")
```

Change the size of the circle:

```python
>>> vlayer.renderer().symbol().setSize(8)
>>> vlayer.triggerRepaint()
```

To change the color of the symbol, use the following code:

```python
>>> vlayer.renderer().symbol().setColor(QColor("green"))
>>> vlayer.triggerRepaint()
```

To change the circles to other symbols, use this code:

```python
>>> vlayer.renderer().symbol().symbolLayer(0).setShape(QgsSimpleMarkerSymbolLayerBase.Pentagon)

>>> vlayer.triggerRepaint()
```

The overall code is:

```python
# Load the point type shapefile
uri = "D:/Python_QGIS/data/KRG_Cities.shp"
vlayer = iface.addVectorLayer(uri, "KRG_Cities", "ogr")

# Change the size of the circle
vlayer.renderer().symbol().setSize(8)
vlayer.triggerRepaint()

# Change the color of the symbol
vlayer.renderer().symbol().setColor(QColor("green"))
vlayer.triggerRepaint()

# Change the circles to other symbols
vlayer.renderer().symbol().symbolLayer(0).setShape(QgsSimpleMarkerSymbolLayerBase.Pentagon)
vlayer.triggerRepaint()
```

In summary, this step-by-step guide provides a simple yet effective way to enhance the appearance of vector layers in PyQGIS using markers. By following the instructions provided, users can easily change the size and color of symbols to create visually stunning maps.
