Change the directory to the "PollProject" folder, where the file [*manage.py*](http://manage.py) exists, using the following commands:

```xml
cd desktop
cd PollProject
```

To create our app, type the following command:

```xml
py manage.py startapp polls
```

Note: "PollProject" and "[manage.py](http://manage.py)" should be written exactly as they appear in the file system, including capitalization if applicable.
