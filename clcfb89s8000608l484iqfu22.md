# 2- Install Flask in a virtual environment

In this tutorial, we use Python 3 and Windows, while Flask also works well on Python 2.7.

Open cmd (Command Prompt) in Windows.

Make a directory and let’s name it “flask-tutorial” using cmd:

```python
mkdir flask-tutorial
```

Change directory to created folder:

```python
cd flask-tutorial
```

From cmd as administrator: create a virtual environment, let's name it “venv”

```python
python -m venv venv C:\Users\gardi\flask-tutorial
```

To activate the virtual environment, change the directory to flask-tutorial:

```python
cd C:\Users\gardi\flask-tutorial
```

Then activate the virtual environment in cmd:

```python
venv\Scripts\activate
```

Install Flask inside “venv” environment using pip install command inside cmd:

```python
pip install Flask
```

To check if the Flask is installed or not, go to Python inside cmd:

```python
python
```

Then import flask package using:

```python
import flask
```
