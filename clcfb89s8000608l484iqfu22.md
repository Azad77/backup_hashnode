Flask is a popular web application framework written in Python. It allows developers to build web applications quickly and easily. In this step-by-step guide, we will walk you through the process of installing Flask in a virtual environment on your Windows machine using Python 3.

Before we start, it's important to understand why we should use a virtual environment. A virtual environment is an isolated Python environment that allows us to install packages and dependencies without affecting the global Python installation on our system. It ensures that our application runs smoothly without conflicts with other packages. Now, let's get started!

Step 1: Open the Command Prompt in Windows.

Step 2: Create a new directory using the command "mkdir flask-tutorial" in the Command Prompt.

```plaintext
mkdir flask-tutorial
```

Step 3: Change the directory to the newly created "flask-tutorial" using the command "cd flask-tutorial".:

```plaintext
cd flask-tutorial
```

Step 4: Create a virtual environment named "venv" using the command "python -m venv venv" in the Command Prompt:

```plaintext
python -m venv venv C:\Users\gardi\flask-tutorial
```

Step 5: Activate the virtual environment using the command "venv\\Scripts\\activate" in the Command Prompt:

```python
venv\Scripts\activate
```

Step 6: Install Flask inside the virtual environment using the command "pip install flask" in the Command Prompt.

```python
pip install Flask
```

Step 7: Verify that Flask is installed correctly by opening Python in the Command Prompt and entering the command "import flask". If there are no errors, you have successfully installed Flask.

```python
import flask
```

Congratulations! You have successfully installed Flask in a virtual environment on your Windows machine. Now, you can start building web applications using this powerful framework. If you encounter any issues during the installation process, try searching for solutions online or consult the Flask documentation.

In conclusion, this step-by-step tutorial provides a clear guide on how to install Flask in a virtual environment on a Windows machine using Python 3. By following these instructions, users can have Flask up and running on their computers, allowing them to start building web applications. Additionally, the tutorial highlights the importance of creating a virtual environment and activating it before installing Flask to avoid conflicts with other packages.
