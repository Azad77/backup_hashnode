Learn how to create meaningful URLs for your modern web applications using Flask. By using the `route()` decorator, you can easily connect functions to specific URLs. Whether you want to define a basic index route or create a custom route that returns a specific message, Flask makes it easy to implement URL routing for your web app. Check out this article to get started with mastering URL routing in Flask today.

Modern web applications use meaningful URLs to help users easily return to them when they remember them.

To connect a function to a URL, use the `route()` decorator.

We can use the index route `('/')` and define it as follows:

```python
@app.route('/')
def index():
    return 'index.html'

if __name__ == "__main__":
    app.run(debug=True)
```

Or we can use the hello route and define it to directly return "Hello, Welcome to blog SmartRS!":

```python
@app.route('/hello')
def hello():
    return 'Hello, Welcome to blog SmartRS!'

if __name__ == "__main__":
    app.run(debug=True)
```

To run the application, use the following command:

```python
python "filename".py
```

In conclusion, Flask provides an easy and efficient way to implement URL routing for modern web applications. By using the `route()` decorator, developers can create user-friendly and easily memorable URLs.
