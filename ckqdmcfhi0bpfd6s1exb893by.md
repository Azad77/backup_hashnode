# 5- Run a Python program

For short commands, we do not need to write scripts. We use command line: In the search window of Windows write:

```python
cmd
```

Then click *Enter* to open command prompt.

To open Python, inside the command prompt write:

```python
python
print("Hello World!")
### Hello World!
```

To close the Python use:

```python
exit()
```

#### Write a simple python file

Open Notepad, inside notepad, write: *print("Hello, World!")*, then save it as: helloworld.py

To run a python file on the command line: Change the directory to the folder (e.i. Python38) that includes the file. then we use command: python file-name.py

```python
cd C:\Python38

python helloworld.py
### Hello, World!
```

helloworld is the name of the file.

Congratulations, you have written and executed your first Python program.
