Sure, here's a possible SEO-friendly intro paragraph:

If you're looking for a beginner's guide on how to upload files using Flask, you're in the right place! In this article, we'll show you how to upload files in Flask step-by-step, using an HTML file with "enctype=multipart/form-data" and a Python script with "GET" and "POST" methods. We'll also provide instructions on how to execute the script and access the upload page on a web browser. Whether you're new to Flask or just need a refresher, this guide will help you get started with file uploads in Flask.

Start with creating **upload.html** file using "enctype=multipart/form-data":

```css
<html>
    <body>

        <form action = "http://localhost:5000/uploader" method = "POST"
            enctype = "multipart/form-data">
            <input type = "file" name = "file" />
            <input type = 'submit'/>
        </form>
    </body>
</html>
```

Now create **upload.py** file using "GET" and "POST" methods and return "Upload succeeded":

```python
from flask import Flask, render_template, request
from werkzeug.utils import secure_filename
app = Flask(__name__)


@app.route('/upload')
def upload():
    return render_template('upload.html')

@app.route('/uploader', methods=["GET", "POST"])
def uploader():
    if request.method == 'POST':
        f = request.files['file']
        f.save(secure_filename(f.filename))
        return ‘Upload succeeded.’
    else:
        return render_template('upload.html')

if __name__ == "__main__":
	app.run(debug=True)
```

Execute the Python script with:

python [upload.py](http://upload.py)

In your web brother go to:

[http://localhost:5000/uploader](http://localhost:5000/uploader)

The following page should be opened:

Click on “Choose file” to select your file.

Then click on the “Submit” button.

You should see: “***Upload succeeded***”

In conclusion, uploading files in Flask is a simple process that involves creating an HTML file with "enctype=multipart/form-data" and a Python script using "GET" and "POST" methods. The script should return "Upload succeeded" upon successful upload. The article also provides steps to execute the Python script and access the upload page on a web browser.
