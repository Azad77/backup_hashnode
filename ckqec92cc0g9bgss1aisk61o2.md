# 7- Control flow in Python

The control flow in Python is set by loops, conditional statements, and function calls.

#### if ... else

```python
a = 50
b = 100
if a > b: 
    print('a is greater than b')
elif a < b:
    print('a is smaller than b')
else:
    print ('a is equal to b')
# a is smaller than b
```

Tip: In Python, spaces are the preferred indentation method, not tabs.

#### while loops

```python
i = 4
while i < 10:
  print(i)
  i += 2
# 4
# 6
# 8
```

#### for loops

```python
for x in "Python":
  print(x)
# P
# y
# t
# h
# o
# n
```

Tip: for loops preferred over while loops.
