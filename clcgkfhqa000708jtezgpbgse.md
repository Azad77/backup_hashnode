Learn how to create meaningful URLs for your modern web applications using Flask. By using the route() decorator, you can easily connect functions to specific URLs. Whether you want to define a basic index route or create a custom route that returns a specific message, Flask makes it easy to implement URL routing for your web app. Check out this article to get started with mastering URL routing in Flask today.

Modern web applications apply meaningful URLs to assist users to come back to them easily when they can remember them.

Use the [**route()**](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.2.x/api/#flask.Flask.route) decorator to connect a function to a URL.

We can use index route ('/') and then define it:

```python
@app.route('/')
def index():
    return 'index.html'

if __name__ == "__main__":
    app.run(debug=True)
```

Or we can use hello route and then define it to return "Hello, Welcome to blog SmartRS!" directly:

```python
@app.route('/hello')
def hello():
    return 'Hello, Welcome to blog SmartRS!'

if __name__ == "__main__":
    app.run(debug=True)
```

Run the application using:

```python
python "filename".py
```

In conclusion, Flask provides an easy and efficient way to implement URL routing for modern web applications. By using the `route()` decorator, developers can create meaningful URLs that are user-friendly and easy to remember.
