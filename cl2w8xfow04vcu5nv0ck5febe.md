# 2- Creating a project

From the command line, cd into a directory where you’d like to store your code, for example, "Desktop"

```xml
cd desktop
```

Then run the following command to create a project named "PollProject":

```xml
django-admin startproject PollProject
```

Change directory to created project:

```xml
cd PollProject
```

To verify your Django project works, we run the following commands:

```xml
py manage.py runserver
```

Then, visit "http://127.0.0.1:8000/" with your web browser. If it work well, you’ll see a “Congratulations!” page:
