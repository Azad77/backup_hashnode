# 8- Introducing the Django Admin

To create an admin user, run the following command:
```
py manage.py createsuperuser
```
Enter any username, for example Azad and press enter. 
Then enter your email address, for example: azad977@gmail.com
Then create a password.
You should see:
```
Superuser created successfully.
```
Now, open a web browser and go to http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/. You should see the adminâ€™s login screen.
Try logging in with the superuser account you created in the previous step. 

To display poll app on the admin index page, open the polls/admin.py file, and edit it to look like this:
```
from django.contrib import admin

from .models import Question

admin.site.register(Question)
```
