For short commands, we do not need to write scripts. We use the command line:

In the search window of Windows, write:

```python
cmd
```

Then press *Enter* to open the command prompt.

To open Python, inside the command prompt, write:

```python
python
print("Hello World!")
### Hello World!
```

To close the Python, use:

```python
exit()
```

#### To write a simple python file:

Open Notepad, inside Notepad, write: `print("Hello, World!")`, then save it as [`helloworld.py`](http://helloworld.py).

To run a Python file on the command line: Change the directory to the folder (e.g., Python38) that includes the file, then use the command:

```python
cd C:\Python38
python helloworld.py
```

Output:

```python
Hello, World!
```

Congratulations, you have written and executed your first Python program.
